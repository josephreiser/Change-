README FILE - Joseph Reiser

Explanation for not finishing the assignment: Part of the reason I was unable to get a working program is that I had never coded in Python until this assignment. I waited until this Friday because I thought I would be able to figure out how to use API's relatively easily, along with the basic Python syntax, but I ended up having a whole host of issues with the groundwork of Python. Basically, even though I have updated my python to the current version, installed pip and manually installed json and requests, I keep getting the same error:

   	"ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests' "
	This error appears on my import statement.

I've surfed the internet and talked to a few people about this issue today, and was redirected to ensuring that I had the right PATH to access the right version of python, but my attempts in fixing this issue failed. I think I may have to fully uninstall and reinstall python, but at this point, with not much time left, I cannot finish this project today. There is a small chance my code might actually work, but I am assuming that there are some errors I was unable to debug due to the fact that this code will not run until I can successfully import requests.
